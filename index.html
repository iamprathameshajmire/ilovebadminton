		 <p>Any praise in the world is less for "RunMachine".Virat Kohli, the epitome of aggressive sportsmanship, was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi family.His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife</p>
		<p>An agressive ,an energetic leader,and a good person,virat was born on November 5th 1988.Virat is a quintessence for any youth who plays Cricket or want to play Cricket for Team India in future. In fact, even to the youth who aren’t playing Cricket, he is a perfect paragon. For instance, I drive a huge amount of inspiration from him. The way he performs consistently under enormouspressure is what I also do in my real life situations, and I have excelled in the same. Also, his aggression is tempered with his performances. Moreover, I am very much attracted as how he implements a rounded policyapproach in his game and does not do any new polarizing things in the heat of the moment. Although saying that is easy, doing that in front of such a huge crowd around you is really tough. I am so much inspired by thisliving legend that sometimes I feel he is my alter-ego.</p>
		<p>Absolute Class… Very hard working and one who times his innings to perfection… He resembles me to Sachin Tendulkar who used to love his game as much as Virat does now… Virat can play every shot in the book, he is probably the best timer of the ball in the world right now… In the initial editions of IPL he failed because he was trying to slog the ball which he is definitely not good at,once he realized that he is not a slogger and timing is his strength he went back to his basics and look at the result now… Probably the best batsman India has produced of course after Sachin Tendulkar…
